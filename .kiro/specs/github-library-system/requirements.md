# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms GitHub repositories into a comprehensive, searchable library system where each repository is treated as a "Book". The system will categorize books by type (games, production, social media, self-help, etc.) and provide library-style search functionality by book names, authors, and categories. When users click on a book, they view the README as the book's description/summary, similar to reading the back cover or leaflet of a physical book. Additionally, it includes a personal publishing system where users can manage and showcase their own published works.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through books (GitHub repositories) like a library catalog, so that I can easily discover projects by category, author, or title.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search term THEN the system SHALL display matching books based on title, author, or description
2. WHEN a user selects a category filter THEN the system SHALL show only books belonging to that category
3. WHEN a user views search results THEN the system SHALL display book information in a library card format with title, author, category, and description
4. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display a helpful "no results found" message with search suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want books to be organized into meaningful categories like a library, so that I can browse projects by type and purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN books are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize them into predefined categories (games, production, social media, self-help, utilities, educational, etc.)
2. WHEN a user views the category list THEN the system SHALL display the number of books in each category
3. WHEN a user clicks on a category THEN the system SHALL filter the view to show only books in that category
4. IF a book doesn't fit existing categories THEN the system SHALL assign it to a "miscellaneous" category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a personal page that shows all my published books, so that I can manage and showcase my contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their personal page THEN the system SHALL display all books they have authored or contributed to
2. WHEN viewing the personal page THEN the system SHALL organize the user's books by category and publication date
3. WHEN a user wants to edit their book information THEN the system SHALL provide editing capabilities for title, description, and category
4. WHEN a user publishes a new book THEN the system SHALL automatically add it to their personal collection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced search and filtering capabilities, so that I can find exactly what I'm looking for efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL support filtering by multiple criteria simultaneously (category, author, date, language)
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL update results in real-time without page refresh
3. WHEN a user wants to sort results THEN the system SHALL provide options to sort by relevance, date, popularity, or alphabetical order
4. WHEN a user clears filters THEN the system SHALL reset to show all available books

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about each book by reading its README, so that I can understand what the project offers like reading the back cover of a book.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a book card THEN the system SHALL display the book's README content as the main description
2. WHEN viewing a book's README THEN the system SHALL show whether the book is public or private
3. WHEN viewing a book's details THEN the system SHALL show related or similar books in the same category
4. WHEN a user wants to access the actual GitHub repository THEN the system SHALL provide a direct link that opens in a new tab

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the library to automatically sync with GitHub repositories, so that the book catalog stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new repositories are added to GitHub THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and categorize them as books within 24 hours
2. WHEN repository information is updated on GitHub THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes in the book catalog
3. WHEN a repository is deleted from GitHub THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding book from the catalog
4. IF the GitHub API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with cached data and retry synchronization when connectivity is restored
